## Key Concept
- Routing Table ---identify the destination ip address, if local, forward to local device, if remote, forward to next router
- static routing --- administratively control the router
- dynamic routing --- no manual route calculation, automatically populated new routes
- routing matric --- different routing protocol has differnet ways of route calculation, lower matric value is better
