# Day 11
## Key Concept
- Routing Table ---identify the destination ip address, if local, forward to local device, if remote, forward to next router
- static routing --- administratively control the router
    - pros --- easy to configure and manage on small network, more secure
    - cons --- hard to configur e on large network, no automatic method to prevent routing loops
- dynamic routing --- no manual route calculation, automatically populated new routes
- routing matric --- different routing protocol has differnet ways of route calculation, lower matric value is better
