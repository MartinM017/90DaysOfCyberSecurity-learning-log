## Key Concept
- SDN --- seperating the control plane from the data plane, which SDN control all the decision making centrally
    - application plane --- network apps, security policies, load balancing etc.
    - control plane --- make decisions
    - data plane --- switches forward traffic only
- SD-WAN --- SDN in a Wide Area Network
    - application aware --- WAN knowns which app is in use, make routing decision based on the application data
    - zero-touch provisioning --- automatic configured, choose the best path
- VXLAN --- designed for large servers provider, extends the layer 2 network over layer 3 network using tunneling
- Zero-trust --- a security control, which mainly said nothing is being trusted, everything need to be verified
