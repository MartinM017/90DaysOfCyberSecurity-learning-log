#Day 2 --- Introduction to Networking Devices

## Learning Objectives
- learn what are networking devices
- get to known what does some of these devices do

## Key Concepts
- #Switch (Layer 2 Device)# --- connect devices inside the #local network#, bridging done in hardware, send data only to the intended device, it utilize the #MAC address# and build a MAC Address Table in order to create connection
- #Router (Layer 3 Device)# --- connect different #networks# globally, decide where the packets should go, it uses #IP address# and maintain a #routing table# 
- #Firewall# --- filters the traffic by port number or application, it often could act as a router (layer 3 device)
- #IDS/IPS (Detection&Prevention)# --- IDS performs #intrusion detection# to monitor traffic and alert suspicious or malicious behaviour, IPS performs #intrusion Prevention# which actively blocks attacks
- #Load Balancer# --- it distributes traffic across servers, provides #Fault Tolerance# which has very fast convergence, and make server outage have no effect
- #Proxy# --- like a #Man-in-the-Middle# between the client and server, it controls the access, monitor traffic, cache information, and manage the request & responce from user and server.
- #Access Point (AP)# --- a device provide connection between wireless devices and wired network
