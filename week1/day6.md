# Day 6 --- Network Communication

## Key Concept
- Unicast --- one-to-one communication, send information between two systems, IPv4 or IPv6
- Multicast --- one-to-many-of-many communication, mutimedia delivery, stock exchanges, dynamic routing updates
- Anycast --- one-to-one-of-many communication, configure the same anycast address on different decives

# Wireless Networking

## Key Concept
- Wireless Network --- managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standard Comittee, continuous updating
- 4G and LTE (Long Term Evolution) --- 150Mb/s download rate
- 5G --- launched in 2020, provide faster large file transfer, huge IoT impact
- Satellite Networking --- communication to a satellite, high latency and high cost

# Copper Cabling

## Key Concept
- Cable --- the fundamental to network communication, everything eventually touches a cable
- Twisted Pair Copper Cabling --- two wires with equal and opposite signals, used to compare and find interference
- Coasial Cable --- two or more forms share a common axis, used in television/digital cable
