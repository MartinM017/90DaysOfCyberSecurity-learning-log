# Day 7 --- Network Topologies

## Key Concept
- Star / Hub and Spoke --- used in most large and small networks, which all devices are connected to a central device
- Mesh --- Mutiple links to the same place, could be fully or partially connected, used in wide area networks
- Hybrid --- a combination of network topologies, most network are hybrid

# Network Architecture

## Key Concept
- Three-tier Architecture --- a stracture of network
    - core --- the "center" of the network, web server, database etc.
    - distribution --- a midpoint between the core and users, manage the path to the end users
    - access --- where the user connect, end station, printers etc.
- Collapse Core --- a two-tier model, combine the core and distribution layer, simpler to design and support
- Traffic flows
    - East-west --- traffic between devices in the same data center, fast response time
    - North-south --- ingress/egress to an outside device
